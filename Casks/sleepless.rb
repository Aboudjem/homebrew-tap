  caveats <<~EOS
    Sleepless is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). Approve the first launch in
    System Settings then Privacy & Security then "Open Anyway".

    To let it toggle lid-close sleep without a password prompt, run once:
      #{appdir}/Sleepless.app/Contents/Resources/grant.sh

    "brew uninstall" cannot remove the passwordless sudoers grant (it is root-owned).
    To remove the grant too, run:
      #{appdir}/Sleepless.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall.sh
